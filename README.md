I created this App for fun. Mainly to get an idea how andriod studio works and to play with kotline java actually. ofcourse I took help from AI.
In this era I think " It doesn't matter how you made it but what ave you made sucessfully? "

Background story 
One day after having a dream after taking with my wife over phone call I saw a dream about making an app where 
I just entered the number of times I wanna say " I love you" and copied and paste it to the whatsApp. Simple isn't is ? haha

How it works ?
-> enter the number of times you wanna multiply the same text
    suppose n = 5
-> type the TEXT in the given text field
    " I love you"
-> tap okay
-> the text gets generated for this case 5 times
    " I love you"
    " I love you"
    " I love you"
    " I love you"
    " I love you"
-> click the copy button
-> pops out a message that COPIED
-> then paste anywere in you want.
-> click reset to start again.
